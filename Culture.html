Starting right from the best of the UAE which is the yummy food! We dive into the emirati kitchen and we have tasty, delicious deyay nashef, chicken cooked in aromatic tomato sauce and  you can eat it with rice or fluffy bread.
 Then we have robyan mashwi which is grilled shrimp with delicious spice, you can also eat this with rice or bread. Other delicious options you can try that UAE has is al harees and luqaimat and more. 


Now let's move on to something very sweet! Yes, the deliciously sweet desserts and side dishes of UAE. Now think of thin noodle strands dipped in sugar syrup with cheese inside, sounds tasty right? there you have it, delicious Kunafa is that dish. 
Then there is Umm Ali, a very tasty creamy bread pudding with different tastes like cinnamon or raisins, it is recommended by us for everyone that's coming to visit. Another yummy option UAE has is rice pudding, it's made out of milk, cream, rice, sugar and nuts. A good benefit of rice pudding is that it's very helpful for digestion or stomach problems. 

Beside the amazing tasty food on our plate we need something to drink right? Exactly! Here you have some of the most popular drinks in UAE, Gahwa which is rich tasty arabic coffee you'll find it almost everywhere in UAE.
 Then we got Sulaimani a hot cup of lemon and mint tea and lastly a refreshing yogurt, salt drink called Labban. We hope you will try out these recommendations!
