Now let's move on to something very sweet! Yes, the deliciously sweet desserts and side dishes of UAE. Now think of thin noodle strands dipped in sugar syrup with cheese inside, sounds tasty right? there you have it, delicious Kunafa is that dish. 
Then there is Umm Ali, a very tasty creamy bread pudding with different tastes like cinnamon or raisins, it is recommended by us for everyone that's coming to visit. Another yummy option UAE has is rice pudding, it's made out of milk, cream, rice, sugar and nuts. A good benefit of rice pudding is that it's very helpful for digestion or stomach problems. <br><br>

Did you know the UAE has stunning cultural clothing that differs from various designs, colors and patterns, and the clothing style varies between men and women! Men in UAE usually wear a kandura or a dishada which is a dress that covers most of the body, and as a head accessory they wear a headdress which is called Gutra.
 To finish off the headdress look, an Agal is placed on top of the Gutra over your head and this will help keep the Gutra on your head , stopping the wind from snatching it. A Gutra will also protect the face when the dust or sand is high and it also helps with the extreme heat in the UAE.<br><br> If you come to visit do not forget to wear an Agal!

Now as for the womens clothing they wear regular clothes and on top of that they put on an Abaya, a black cloak that covers most of the body except the feet and palms, and hides the bright clothing underneath.
 There is also Kaftans which is like a dress that comes in many pretty colors and designs, women in the UAE usually wear a kaftan when they are at home or with other women. 
 The cultural and traditional clothing worn in UAE are really stunning and the most interesting difference between womens and mens clothing is that men tend to wear white and light colors while women wear dark and black clothing. Most of the clothing covers almost the entire body as that's what's seen appropriate and respectful within the culture and in the country.

Are you excited to try out these fine cultural and traditional clothing in the UAE?!
