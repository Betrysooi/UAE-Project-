                    <b>Falconry</b> is one of the most traditional sports in the United Arab Emirates 
                    and has been a tradition for more than 2,000 years. It is still being passed 
                    down from generation to generation to keep the tradition alive. It is said that 
                    the requirement to be able to control a falcon is to have patience and bond with 
                    the bird, so that the both of you can trust each other. For some time now falconers 
                    have been able to breed falcons and produce new techniques to manage a falcon. The UAE 
                    has a falcon experience that gives you an unimaginable experience of an ancient tradition 
                    in person. Falconry was first used as a method for hunting in the past, nowadays falconers breed 
                    and train their falcons. But they occasionally take their falcons to exhibitions and events that are 
                    taking place all year long in UAE. The <b>national bird</b> of UAE is the falcon, which is the official emblem 
                    of the country that consists of a <b>golden falcon</b>. The reason the falcon is the country’s national bird 
                    is because it symbolizes <b>courage</b> and <b>strength</b>.

                    Before the United Arab Emirates became a country, it consisted of rival tribes that ruled 
                    various parts of the country. Since the rival tribes were causing problems, Britain offered 
                    protection in exchange for some land. The desperation for peace led to countless tribes accepting 
                    Britain’s offer in 1820. In 1968 Britain came across lots of financial losses which lead to them 
                    withdrawing. On December 2, 1971, the rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Al-Ain, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain 
                    agreed on the unification of the country, which resulted in creating the United Arab Emirates. On the 
                    same day, the rulers declared the country’s independence from Britain. Ever since that day citizens of 
                    UAE highly anticipates the national day which celebrates the unification of United Arab Emirates. The 
                    <b>national day</b> is an especially important day since it shows how peace can be achieved without force or wars. 
                    The 50th anniversary of being independent was celebrated on December 2, 2021.

                When people talk about the United Arab Emirates, they often think about Dubai which is 
                one of the biggest shopping destinations that consists of over seventy malls and still 
                counting, while new ones open every year. Dubai is a shopping district that is mostly made 
                up of exclusive brands and expensive clothing. That is when the <b>Dubai shopping festival</b> comes 
                in and offers exceptional discounts on exclusive brands. Dubai shopping festival initially started 
                on February 16, 1996, as a retail event, which later resulted in becoming a tourist attraction that 
                attracts three million tourists worldwide each year. The <b>Dubai shopping festival</b> lasts for a month 
                where the discounts and sales on products are crazy, the festival starts from the first week of January 
                to the first week of February. The festival is often held throughout Dubai since several malls and 
                retail stores participate. To celebrate the festival some parks, hold different events and light fireworks
