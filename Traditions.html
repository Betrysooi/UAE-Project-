            <h1>United Arab Emirates Traditions</h1>
            <p>
                Falconry is one of the most traditional sports in the United Arab Emirates 
                and has been a tradition for more than 2,000 years. It is still being passed 
                down from generation to generation to keep the tradition alive. It is said that 
                the requirement to be able to control a falcon is to have patience and bond with 
                the bird, so that the both of you can trust each other. For some time now falconers 
                have been able to breed falcons and produce new techniques to manage a falcon. The UAE 
                has a falcon experience that gives you an unimaginable experience of an ancient tradition 
                in person. Falconry was first used as a method for hunting in the past, nowadays falconers breed 
                and train their falcons. But they occasionally take their falcons to exhibitions and events that are 
                taking place all year long in UAE. The national bird of UAE is the falcon, which is the official emblem 
                of the country that consists of a golden falcon. The reason the falcon is the countryâ€™s national bird 
                is because it symbolizes courage and strength.
